{"body":"# Quickgit\r\n\r\nQuickgit is designed to fix problems and make Git easier for daily command line use. All of this is open source and available on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Required\r\n\r\n* A Linux/UNIX based operating system.\r\n* Git-Core\r\n\r\n### Recommended\r\n\r\n* SSH Repo remotes (as opposed to HTTP remotes) \r\n* GitHub repos (most commands work best using GitHub)\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\nI'm updating Quickgit all the time when I need to do a lot with Git often, so I'll push an update to a new branch every time I consider an update stable for release.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nQuickgit can be ran via exporting the PATH variable to the downloaded location for now, a better solution is being worked on.\r\n\r\n_Note: \"quickgit changelog\" is only functional with all QuickGit binaries located at /quickgit. This will be changed to be better in the future._","name":"Quickgit","note":"Don't delete this file!
